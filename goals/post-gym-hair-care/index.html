              <h2>Why Post-Gym Hair Care Matters</h2>
              <p>Workouts create a challenging environment for hair: sweat, heat, increased friction, and extended periods in tight protective styles. Sweat contains salt and other compounds that can irritate the scalp and weigh down hair. Combined with increased oil production from elevated body temperature, post-workout hair faces significant stress.</p>
              <p>However, with smart pre-workout and post-workout practices, you can protect your hair while maintaining your fitness routine. This program shows you how to stay active without sacrificing hair health.</p>

              <div class="info-box tip" style="margin-top:var(--space-6)">
                <h4 class="info-box-title">The Challenge</h4>
                <p>The key is managing sweat before it damages hair, establishing a post-workout routine that minimizes damage, and giving your scalp time to recover between workouts. You don't have to choose between fitness and healthy hair — you just need the right strategy.</p>
              </div>

                    <h4>Master Protective Hairstyles</h4>
                    <p>Before each workout, wear your hair in a protective style: loose braids, loose buns, or low ponytails. The goal is to minimize manipulation and friction during movement. Tight hairstyles restrict blood flow and create tension on follicles. Loose styles protect without this stress.</p>
                  </div>

                    <h4>Apply Pre-Workout Protection Spray</h4>
                    <p>Before workouts, lightly spray a protective product on your lengths and ends. This creates a barrier that reduces sweat absorption and friction damage. Look for lightweight, water-based formulas designed for active lifestyles. Avoid heavy products that get weighed down by sweat.</p>

                    <h4>Use a Sweatband or Headband</h4>
                    <p>Wear a cotton sweatband or headband around your hairline to absorb sweat before it reaches your scalp. This simple accessory prevents sweat from pooling at the scalp and creating an irritating environment. Cotton is preferred over synthetic materials.</p>

                    <h4>Apply Dry Shampoo Pre-Workout</h4>
                    <p>Before workouts, apply dry shampoo to your roots. This absorbs excess oil throughout your workout and reduces your scalp's oil absorption of sweat. This keeps your scalp cleaner during the workout and reduces the need for immediate shampooing afterward.</p>

                    <h4>Remove Sweat Immediately and Gently</h4>
                    <p>After workouts, within 5-15 minutes, gently remove sweat with a clean towel or soft cloth. Use gentle blotting motions — do NOT rub vigorously. Vigorous rubbing damages hair when it's most vulnerable (when sweat-saturated). Gentle removal prevents this damage.</p>

                    <h4>Rinse with Cool Water (No Shampoo Yet)</h4>
                    <p>Rinse your hair and scalp with cool water to rinse away sweat, salt, and residue. You don't need to shampoo immediately — just a water rinse removes most sweat. Use lukewarm or cool water, not hot, which irritates the scalp further.</p>

                    <p>You don't need to shampoo after every workout. A water rinse is often sufficient. Shampoo only 1-2 times per week or when you've done particularly intense/long workouts. Over-shampooing after every workout leads to more damage than sweat alone.</p>

                    <p>On non-wash days, use dry shampoo to manage oil buildup from workouts. This keeps your scalp fresher without requiring daily shampooing. Dry shampoo between washes extends your wash schedule and reduces damage from frequent shampooing.</p>
