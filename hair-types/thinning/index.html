              <h2>Understanding Thinning Hair</h2>
              <p>Thinning hair is not a hair type — it's a condition that can affect any texture. Whether you're noticing your part widening, your hairline shifting, increased shedding in the shower, or reduced density overall, you're not alone. Most men experience some degree of thinning during their lifetime, and the experience can feel isolating even though it's incredibly common.</p>
              <p>We want to be upfront: no routine, product, or habit can reverse genetic hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). That requires medical intervention. But there are real, meaningful things within your control — gentle handling, scalp environment support, nutrition, stress management, and avoiding habits that accelerate damage. This guide focuses on those controllable factors. It's honest about what habits can and cannot do, and it tells you clearly when it's time to see a professional.</p>

            <!-- Fast Start Routine -->
            <div class="reveal" style="margin-top:var(--space-10)">
              <h2>5-Minute Gentle Start Routine</h2>
              <p>A low-risk daily routine focused on gentle care and scalp support. Nothing aggressive — just the basics done right.</p>

              <div class="routine-step">
                <div class="routine-step-number">1</div>
                <div class="routine-step-content">
                  <h4>Gentle Sulfate-Free Wash</h4>
                  <p>On wash days, use a gentle sulfate-free shampoo. Apply with minimal pressure — just your fingertips, never nails. Massage the scalp softly for 60 seconds and let the lather rinse through the lengths. The goal is to cleanse without irritating the scalp or stressing fragile strands.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

                  <h4>Scalp Massage (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                  <p>While in the shower or after, spend 2-3 minutes gently massaging your scalp with your fingertips in slow circular motions. This supports blood circulation to hair follicles. Use light to medium pressure — this should feel relaxing, not forceful. You can do this daily, even on non-wash days.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

                  <h4>Lightweight Conditioner on Lengths</h4>
                  <p>Apply a lightweight, volumizing conditioner from mid-lengths to ends only. Avoid the scalp and roots — conditioner near the roots weighs thinning hair down and makes it appear flatter. Leave for 1-2 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Pat Dry — Never Rub or Tug</h4>
                  <p>Gently pat hair dry with a soft microfiber towel. Never rub, wring, or pull. Thinning hair is more fragile and susceptible to mechanical damage. Treat it as gently as you would handle anything delicate.</p>

                  <h4>Style Without Tension</h4>
                  <p>If using any styling product, choose lightweight, volumizing formulas. Avoid tight hairstyles, aggressive combing, and any tools that pull on thinning areas. Let hair air dry when possible. If using a dryer, keep it on low heat and low speed.</p>

                  <h4>Daily Scalp Massage (5 minutes)</h4>
                  <p>In addition to shower massages, dedicate 5 minutes daily to a dedicated dry scalp massage. Use gentle circular motions across the entire scalp. Some research suggests this may support blood flow to follicles. At minimum, it reduces tension and feels good.</p>

                  <h4>Monthly Progress Photos</h4>
                  <p>Take photos from the same angle, in the same lighting, once per month. This removes the guesswork and anxiety of daily mirror-checking. Photos help you track real changes over time — and give you useful information if you decide to see a dermatologist.</p>

                  <h4>Nutrition Check-In (weekly)</h4>
                  <p>Review your weekly diet. Hair needs protein, iron, zinc, biotin, and omega-3 fatty acids. You don't need supplements if your diet covers these — focus on eggs, fish, leafy greens, nuts, and lean meats. If you're skipping meals or eating poorly, that's a controllable factor worth addressing.</p>

                  <h4>Gentle Clarifying Wash (Every 2 weeks)</h4>
                  <p>Use a gentle clarifying shampoo every two weeks to remove product buildup that can clog follicles and weigh down already-thin hair. Always follow with a lightweight conditioner on the ends.</p>

            <div class="reveal" style="margin-top:var(--space-10)">
              <h2>Wash Frequency Guide</h2>
              <p>Thinning hair needs a gentle balance. Over-washing irritates the scalp; under-washing allows buildup that weighs hair down. Here's your starting point:</p>
              <div class="info-box tip">
                <div class="info-box-title">Recommended: Every 2-3 Days (Gentle Formula)</div>
                <p>Most men with thinning hair do well washing every 2-3 days with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo. On non-wash days, rinse with water only if needed. Avoid daily washing — it can irritate the scalp and strip oils that help remaining hair look fuller. If you exercise daily, a water-only rinse is sufficient between shampoo days. Choose volumizing or thickening shampoos that add body without harsh chemicals.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- When to See a Professional -->
            <div class="reveal" style="margin-top:var(--space-10)">
              <h2>When to See a Professional</h2>
              <div class="info-box warning">
                <div class="info-box-title">This Is Important — Please Read</div>
                <p>Habits and routines can support scalp health, but they cannot treat medical conditions. See a dermatologist if you experience any of the following:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top:var(--space-3);margin-bottom:var(--space-3)">
                  <li><strong>Sudden or rapid hair loss</strong> — losing clumps or noticing dramatic thinning over weeks rather than months</li>
                  <li><strong>Patchy bald spots</strong> — circular or irregular patches may indicate alopecia areata, a medical condition</li>
                  <li><strong>Scalp pain, redness, or itching</strong> — persistent irritation may signal an underlying scalp condition</li>
                  <li><strong>Hair loss after illness, medication, or major stress</strong> — telogen effluvium is treatable but needs professional assessment</li>
                  <li><strong>You want to explore medical treatments</strong> — finasteride, minoxidil, PRP therapy, and other options require medical guidance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is no shame in seeking help. A dermatologist can diagnose the specific cause of your thinning and discuss options that are beyond the scope of any habit-based guide. The earlier you go, the more options you typically have.</p>

                <li style="counter-increment:mistakes;padding:var(--space-4) 0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light)">
                  <strong>1. Spending money on "miracle" products.</strong> The market is full of expensive shampoos, supplements, and devices that promise regrowth with little to no evidence. Before buying anything, check whether it has genuine clinical research behind it — and talk to a dermatologist.
                </li>
                <li style="counter-increment:mistakes;padding:var(--space-4) 0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light)">
                  <strong>2. Waiting too long to see a professional.</strong> Many men avoid the dermatologist because they're not sure it's "bad enough." The truth is that earlier intervention gives you more options. If you're noticing changes that worry you, make an appointment.
                </li>
                <li style="counter-increment:mistakes;padding:var(--space-4) 0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light)">
                  <strong>3. Overwashing or using harsh shampoos.</strong> Aggressive cleansing with sulfate-heavy shampoos strips the scalp and irritates follicles. Switch to a gentle, sulfate-free formula and wash every 2-3 days at most.
                </li>
                <li style="counter-increment:mistakes;padding:var(--space-4) 0;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light)">
                  <strong>4. Neglecting nutrition and sleep.</strong> Hair is a non-essential tissue — your body prioritizes vital organs first. If you're sleep-deprived, under-eating, or skipping protein, your hair will show it. These are controllable factors worth optimizing.
                </li>
                <li style="counter-increment:mistakes;padding:var(--space-4) 0">
                  <strong>5. Obsessive daily checking.</strong> Staring at your hairline every morning creates anxiety that doesn't help. Switch to monthly photo tracking — it gives you real data instead of daily emotional reactions.
                </li>
